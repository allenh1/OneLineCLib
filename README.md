One-Line CLibrary
==================
 * Why are we doing this? That's a fair question. You see, 


Rules:
-------
 * All function templates must match those in the GNU C library.
 * All code should function as stipulated by GNU standard.
 * All functions are written on a single line.
 * No variable may be longer than one letter in name, unless this conflicts
   with the GNU definition of the function.
 * Gross code is good code.
